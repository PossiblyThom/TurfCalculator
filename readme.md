<h1>Turf Calculator</h1>
<h2>About this Project</h2>
I started this project for one of my college assignments. The brief was to create an application which was able to recieve an input from the user as to the area of Turf that they wanted, and the app would calculate it.
The requirements of the application were:

*	The customer should enter all measurements in metres (m).
*	The customer should enter the length and width of their lawn in metres (m).
*	The turfs are sold in standardised rolls measuring 1m long x 0.6m wide.
*	Each roll of turf costs Â£2.50
*	The program must then calculate the total number of rolls for the garden.
*	The program must then add an additional 10% of the total number of rolls of turf to allow for wastage.
*	The program should then calculate the total cost of the turf required.
*	The program must display an itemised bill showing:
  *	The initial number of rolls of turf required;
  *	The total number of rolls of turf required including the additional 10%;
  *	The total price of the turf;

The assignment was originally given to be written in Java but I recieved permission from my lecturer to use VB (since it is a faster language to code in and I was attempting to catch up with weeks of assignments missed due to illness).
